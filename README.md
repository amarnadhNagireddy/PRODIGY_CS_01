Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher algorithm with a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI). The Caesar Cipher is a classic encryption technique that shifts the letters of a message by a specified number of positions in the alphabet.

Features:

1.Encryption and Decryption: Allows users to easily encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.

2.Custom Shift Value: Users can input a custom shift value for the cipher.

3.Interactive GUI: Built with a Python GUI library (e.g., Tkinter), the application provides an intuitive interface for inputting text and viewing results.

4.Error Handling: Handles invalid inputs, such as non-numeric shift values or unsupported characters.

5.Real-Time Feedback: Immediately displays the encrypted or decrypted text upon user input.


How It Works:

step-1:Enter the text you wish to encrypt or decrypt in the input field.

step-:Provide a numeric shift value (positive for encryption, negative for decryption).

step-3:Click the Encrypt or Decrypt button to see the result.

Technologies Used:

->Python: For implementing the Caesar Cipher logic.

->Tkinter: For creating the graphical user interface.
